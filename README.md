# Analysis-of-COVID19-Medical-Resource


To discover the relationship between medical resource and number of patients of COVID-19 in China, we applied some regression model on our open case dataset.

### We've found that abundant medical resources:
1. Will help to improve the cure rate as well as lower the number of cure  and the fatality rate  (excluding Hubei)
2. Will **NOT** help to lower the number of fatality
